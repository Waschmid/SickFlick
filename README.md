## Sickflick

Basic Android application that displays a list of recently released movies by querying The Movie Database API. User can select a movie from the list for more detailed info, add a movie to a 'watch later' list, and change the date range movies for the list are pulled from. 

I mainly built this to get familiar with more parts of the android library such as listviews/adapters, loaders, and content providers. 

The Picasso external library was used for image loading and caching - http://square.github.io/picasso/
